# BlockbenchMCP - Blockbench Model Context Protocol Integration

BlockbenchMCP connects Blockbench to Claude AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Claude to directly interact with and control Blockbench. This integration enables AI-assisted 3D modeling, texture creation, and block model manipulation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Two-way communication**: Connect Claude AI to Blockbench through a socket-based server
- **Real-time command tracking**: Monitor all MCP commands with a dedicated history panel
- **Model manipulation**: Create, modify, and delete block models in Blockbench
- **Live feedback**: Get instant responses from Blockbench operations
- **Extensible architecture**: Easy to add new tools and capabilities

## 🏗️ Components

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Blockbench Plugin** (`apps/mcp-plugin`): A Blockbench plugin that creates a socket server within Blockbench to receive and execute commands
2. **MCP Server** (`apps/mcp-server`): A Node.js server that implements the Model Context Protocol and connects to the Blockbench plugin

## �️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Blockbench** 4.0 or newer
- **Node.js** 18.0 or newer
- **pnpm** package manager

Install pnpm if you haven't already:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enfpdev/blockbench-mcp.git
cd blockbench-mcp
pnpm install
```

### 2. Build the Project

```bash
pnpm build
```

### 3. Install the Blockbench Plugin

1. Build the plugin: `cd apps/mcp-plugin && pnpm build`
2. Open Blockbench
3. Go to **File** > **Plugins** > **Load Plugin from File**
4. Select the built plugin file from `apps/mcp-plugin/dist/`
5. Enable the plugin by checking the box next to "MCP Plugin"

### 4. Claude Desktop Integration

Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**Location:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "blockbench": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/blockbench-mcp/apps/mcp-server/dist/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Starting the Connection

1. In Blockbench, open the plugin panel (if not visible, go to **View** > **Panels**)
2. Find the "MCP Plugin" panel
3. Click "Connect to MCP Server"
4. The plugin will start listening on port 9999

### Using with Claude

Once the configuration is set in Claude Desktop and the plugin is running in Blockbench, you'll see a hammer icon with tools for Blockbench MCP.

#### Capabilities

- Get model and project information
- Create, delete, and modify block models
- Apply textures and materials
- Execute custom modeling operations
- Real-time command history tracking

### Example Commands

Here are some examples of what you can ask Claude to do:

- "Create a simple sword model with proper proportions"
- "Add a crossguard to the existing sword model"
- "Create a chest model with opening animation"
- "Generate a pickaxe tool with different material variants"
- "Show me the current model structure and elements"
- "Create a character head with facial features"

## 🔧 Development

### Development Mode

```bash
# Start both server and plugin in development mode
pnpm dev

# Or start individually
cd apps/mcp-server && pnpm dev
cd apps/mcp-plugin && pnpm dev
```

### Version Management

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management:

```bash
# Record changes
pnpm changeset

# Update versions
pnpm version

# Build all packages
pnpm build
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Connection issues**: Make sure the Blockbench plugin is running and the MCP server is configured in Claude Desktop
- **Port conflicts**: The plugin uses port 9999 by default. Make sure no other application is using this port
- **Plugin not loading**: Verify that the plugin file is properly built and Blockbench version is compatible
- **Command timeouts**: Try simplifying your requests or breaking them into smaller steps

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Communication Protocol

The system uses Socket.IO for real-time communication between components:

- **WebSocket connection** on port 9999
- **JSON-based commands** with type and payload structure
- **Event-driven architecture** for responsive interactions

### Architecture

```
Claude AI ← MCP Protocol → MCP Server ← Socket.IO → Blockbench Plugin
```

## ⚠️ Limitations & Security Considerations

- The plugin allows executing code within Blockbench, which can be powerful but potentially risky
- Always save your work before using experimental features
- Complex operations might need to be broken down into smaller steps
- Network communication happens over localhost only for security
